Arduino IDE Example :

Ethernet/WebClientRepeating.ino ->

Repeating Web client

This sketch connects to a a web server and makes a request
using a Wiznet Ethernet shield. You can use the Arduino Ethernet shield, or
the Adafruit Ethernet shield, either one will work, as long as it's got
a Wiznet Ethernet module on board.

This example uses DNS, by assigning the Ethernet client with a MAC address,
IP address, and DNS address.

Circuit:
Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13
